Dr. Jessica Kendall-Bar is a Scripps Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Marine Biotechnology & Biomedicine at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. Jessie's postdoctoral work builds on her doctoral research at UC Santa Cruz, where she developed innovative tools to non-invasively measure and visualize the sleep patterns of wild seals. At Scripps, Jessie seeks to compare the extreme physiology of elite divers- including humans, penguins, seals, and whales. A scientist by training, Jessie's research has spanned from computer graphics to human sleep deprivation and arthropod mating behavior. However, Jessie believes that scientific progress is futile unless communicated effectively. Her animations, illustrated children's books, and data visualizations aim to accurately portray science and its role in preserving underwater ecosystems. Her work as a science communication specialist distills scientific complexity into data-driven stories, graphics, and animations that accelerate research, outreach, and conservation.

Hey y'all! My name is Audrey. I graduated from UCSC in 2016 with a degree in marine bio. I've since worked in a number of different labs and research settings, but eventually found my home in non-profit work and environmental justice activism. I'm currently the associate director of a local EJ non-profit. I also work as a body-painter and freelance artist creating functional goods from up-cycled "trash" and carbon-reducing materials. And I'm queer as hell!
