Dr Max Czapanskiy is a postdoctoral scholar with UCSC's Ocean Science department and the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. His research and teaching promote open science as an essential step in transforming scientific culture. A former software developer, his past research applied his computational background to questions in movement ecology and ecophysiology, including flight dynamics of seabirds and cardiovascular function of baleen whales. During that time, he observed the connections between access to data (or, conversely, data hoarding), power dynamics within scientific culture, and toxic workplace environments. He believes the open science movement has the potential to dismantle barriers to participation and disempower abusive scientists. But unless radical reform is an explicit goal, the movement will inevitably recapitulate the existing power structures behind a new facade. Today, he is focused on building the technical and social capacity of early career researchers to self-determine their careers and roles in science.Â
