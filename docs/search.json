Her research interests include human-wildlife conflict, carnivore movement ecology, multidisciplinary GIS, and using participatory methods for more effective and inclusive conservation outcomes. She has spent the last decade working in conservation biology and natural resource management around the USA and in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and has also served in various capacities as an informal educator. Christine’s current research focuses on social-ecological drivers of carnivore movement, conflict, and coexistence in the Bay Area and in Kenya.\nCheck out her website, https://scrappynaturalist.com/"

Their research focuses on the ecology and evolution of wetland plants that are responding to rapid environmental shifts associated with climate change. They received their Bachelors in Biology from Vassar College in 2016, and then worked for the Conservation Land Management collecting native seeds for Post-Hurricane Sandy restoration projects in the mid-Atlantic. Following this, they earned their PhD at George Washington University for their dissertation entitled “Genotype by environment interactions of a high marsh foundation species affected by sea-level rise”. Dr. Kottler is now a Smith Conservation Fellow, and is conducting postdoctoral research at the University of Colorado Boulder on the restoration genomics of endangered vernal pool plants in California. In 2022, Dr. Kottler founded the Trans and Gender-nonconforming Fieldwork Alliance (TGFA) to build community and provide resources for fellow trans and gender-nonconforming field scientists, allies and institutions.\nCheck out their website here."

    "text": "BIOE 199F - UC Santa Cruz - Spring 2023\nFor hundreds of years, scientific discovery has been driven by heteronormative Western perspectives on what is “natural.” Scientific disciplines that ignore queer voices lose the insights of talented scientists and miss the opportunity to discover a world that is not only more inclusive, but also more scientifically robust.\nThrough this seminar series, students will hear presentations from queer speakers detailing their research in ecology and conservation biology. Speakers and students will explore the intersections between queerness and ecology, including discussions of queer experiences in a field that has historically marginalized queer identities and how viewing the natural world through a queer lens has the capacity to improve and alter mainstream scientific insights around sex, gender, and beyond. Our overarching intent is to uplift queer voices, build community, highlight diverse approaches to science including a variety of career paths, and begin conversations around the intersection of queerness and ecology.\nUC Santa Cruz ranks among the most LGBTQ+ friendly universities in the country and has an extremely diverse graduate population. We believe that there is substantial demand for interdisciplinary courses that bridge the gap between identity and scientific discovery. The proposed class will encourage thoughtful engagement with the scientific process and give students with marginalized identities a place to connect with their queer scientific community.\nMondays\n3:30-5pm for undergraduate students\n4-6pm for graduate students\nCBB 110, UCSC Coastal Campus"
