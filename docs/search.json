    "text": "Dr Max Czapanskiy is a postdoctoral scholar with UCSC's Ocean Science department and the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. His research and teaching promote open science as an essential step in transforming scientific culture. A former software developer, his past research applied his computational background to questions in movement ecology and ecophysiology, including flight dynamics of seabirds and cardiovascular function of baleen whales. During that time, he observed the connections between access to data (or, conversely, data hoarding), power dynamics within scientific culture, and toxic workplace environments. He believes the open science movement has the potential to dismantle barriers to participation and disempower abusive scientists. But unless radical reform is an explicit goal, the movement will inevitably recapitulate the existing power structures behind a new facade. Today, he is focused on building the technical and social capacity of early career researchers to self-determine their careers and roles in science."

However, Jessie believes that scientific progress is futile unless communicated effectively. Her animations, illustrated children’s books, and data visualizations aim to accurately portray science and its role in preserving underwater ecosystems. Her work as a science communication specialist distills scientific complexity into data-driven stories, graphics, and animations that accelerate research, outreach, and conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey y’all!

    "text": "BIOE 199F - UC Santa Cruz - Spring 2023\nFor hundreds of years, scientific discovery has been driven by heteronormative Western perspectives on what is “natural.” Scientific disciplines that ignore queer voices lose the insights of talented scientists and miss the opportunity to discover a world that is not only more inclusive, but also more scientifically robust.\nThrough this seminar series, students will hear presentations from queer speakers detailing their research in ecology and conservation biology. Speakers and students will explore the intersections between queerness and ecology, including discussions of queer experiences in a field that has historically marginalized queer identities and how viewing the natural world through a queer lens has the capacity to improve and alter mainstream scientific insights around sex, gender, and beyond. Our overarching intent is to uplift queer voices, build community, highlight diverse approaches to science including a variety of career paths, and begin conversations around the intersection of queerness and ecology.\nUC Santa Cruz ranks among the most LGBTQ+ friendly universities in the country and has extremely diverse undergraduate and graduate populations. We believe that there is substantial demand for interdisciplinary courses that bridge the gap between identity and scientific discovery. The proposed class will encourage thoughtful engagement with the scientific process and give students with marginalized identities a place to connect with their queer scientific community.\nMondays\n3:30-5pm for undergraduate students\n4-6pm for graduate students\nCBB 110, UCSC Coastal Campus"
