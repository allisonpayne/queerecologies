Allison is a PhD student in the Beltran Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her dissertation research is focused on instrumenting elephant seals at AÃ±o Nuevo State Park with passive acoustic monitoring devices in order to listen to the sounds of the deep ocean. Her role with FieldFutures allows her to express her passion for field safety and inclusion. As a queer ecologist, she has been dreaming of a class like this one for a long time! In her spare time, she likes to rearrange trinkets on bookshelves, wear giant earrings, make playlists, and taste test baked goods.
